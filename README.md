# R Practice Repo

> These are a number of practice problems I have compiled over the years to teach myself R.  
> These range in complexity from *very simple* to *kinda hard*.   
>> Most of the initial commits were my first attempt at tackling the problem.  
>> Other modified commits were my attempt at writing better code as I learned.
